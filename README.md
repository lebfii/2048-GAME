This is a Python implementation of the classic 2048 game using Pygame. The objective of the game is to slide and merge tiles on a 4×4 grid to create the 2048 tile (or achieve the highest score possible).

How to Play

Use Arrow Keys to move tiles in the desired direction:

Left (←)

Right (→)

Up (↑)

Down (↓)

Merge tiles with the same value to create larger numbers.

Try to reach 2048 before running out of moves.

Game ends when no valid moves are left.

Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install Pygame if you don’t have it already:

pip install pygame

Run the Game
